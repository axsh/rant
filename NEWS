0.4.0.

Fixes and minor improvements:
* Fixes for Ruby 1.8.1 compatibility.
* Fixes for Rules and multiple buildfiles per project.
* rant-import created scripts append inlined files to
  $LOADED_FEATURES.

== Rant 0.4.0

Incompatible changes:
* _Internal_: A generator has to respond to +rant_gen+ instead of
  +rant_generate+.

New features:
* Creating zip and gzipped tar archives on all supported platforms
  without installing extra software. Seamless integration with
  rant-import.
  Read doc/package.rdoc[link:files/doc/package_rdoc.html].
* The standard RubyPackage tasks create zip and gzipped tar archives
  (and optional gem packages) on all platforms, including Windows,
  now.
* rant-import recognizes the new directives +uncomment+ and +remove+.

  variables directly, they are available through +var+ now. Read

    include Sys
  with
