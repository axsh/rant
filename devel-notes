== Running RDoc programmatically
require 'rdoc/rdoc'
rdoc = RDoc::RDoc.new
begin
    rdoc.document(%w(like args from commandline))
rescue RDoc::RDocError
    $stderr.puts "Error when running rdoc: " + $!.message
end

== Changing the behaviour of Rant from Rantfiles
Perhaps a method named like `behave' would be appropriate to to
set options of the Rant application.

== Subdirectories
Allow the use of `#' at the start of a pathname to tell rant that
it should be interpreted relative to the project's root directory.

== Directory structure of +lib/+
+lib/+ contains only two entries:
[rant.rb]      Used to require rantlib and include +Rant+ for small
	       build scripts.
[rant/]	       All files matching <tt>/^rant\w+\.rb$/</tt> are considered
	       as Rant core. Others contain utilities, helper classes,
	       Generators and similar.
[rant/plugin]  Each file ending in <tt>.rb</tt> in this directory is
               considered to load support for one Rant plugin.

== Performance
With version 0.2.6, the big performance problem with task lookup
(caused very slow dependency resolving) is fixed.
The next performance improvement should target Rantfile reading,
especially task creation.

== RubyPackage generator
Currently, the package task(s) generated by RubyPackage doesn't
recognize (and repackage) when files/directories are removed (from the
sources).
