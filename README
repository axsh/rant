= Rant -- Ruby's ant

Rant is a flexible build tool written entirely in Ruby.

The equivalent to a _Makefile_ for _make_ is the _Rantfile_. An
_Rantfile_ is actually a valid Ruby script that is read in by the
_rant_ command.

Rant currently features:
* Rantfiles are written in Ruby.
* Defining custom tasks
* Automated packaging, testing and RDoc generation for Ruby
  applications and libraries.
* Primitive support for compiling C# sources portably with csc, cscc
  and mcs.
* A _configure_ plugin for easy environment and build-parameter
  checking (but not like autoconf!) which saves data in a yaml file.
* The <em>rant-import</em> command creates a monolithic rant script,
  so you don't depend on an rant installation anymore.

== Roadmap

Installing Rant::
    read the section _Installation_ in this document
License::
    read the section _Copying_ in this document
Invoking *rant*::
    read doc/rant.rdoc[link:files/doc/rant_rdoc.html]
Writing an *Rantfile*::
    read doc/rantfile.rdoc[link:files/doc/rantfile_rdoc.html]

== Installation

Of course you need Ruby to run rant. You can get the latest Ruby
package from the {Ruby hompage}[http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/].

There are two ways to install Rant on your system:

=== Installing Rant as a RubyGem

RubyGems has to be installed on your system. Check this by trying
the _gem_ command:
    % gem
If this prints a help message, RubyGems should work. Otherwise
install Rant as described in the next section.
Now the following command:
    % gem install --remote rant
will download and install Rant. Depending on the RubyGems
configuration, you will probably need superuser privileges.
Then try to run:
    % rant --version
which should print name and version of the _rant_ command. If this
is done, you have successfully installed Rant. Congratulations!

=== Conventional installation

First download the latest version of Rant from
http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=615. Choose the .zip or .tar.gz
file, whatever you like, with the highest version number. Then unpack
the archive, cd to the new directory and run the setup.rb script. This
could look like:
    % tar -xzf rant-<version>.tar.gz
    % cd rant-<version>
    % ruby setup.rb
Depending on your Ruby installation, you'll probably need superuser
privileges for the last command. If you wan't to install Rant in
another location than the default, run
    % ruby setup.rb --help
which will show you a bunch of options for the installation.

After performing the steps listed above, try to run
    % rant --version
to verify Rant was installed correctly.
