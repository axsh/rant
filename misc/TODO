== Don't use testrb as testrunner for RubyTest.

== Solve archiving dependency problem
Because of timed depdencies, the archiving tasks don't recognize if
the only change is that a file was removed. The only exception is a
primitive +Archive+ task whith manifest synchronization. The problem
can be solved by writing a list of files parallel to archive creation
or to write a signature of the filelist.

== Dependency alternation
Allow at least two tasks as one dependency where the first available
will actually used to satisfy the dependency, pseudo code:
    task :a => :b | :c
Rant should first try :b and if the task :b exists and succeds
:c won't be considered, if task :b doesn't exist, rant should try
to make :c.

== GET RID OF CLASS Rant::Path
Done (0.3.7).

== Packaging
Try minitar if tar is not available.
Done (0.3.9).

== C# plugin
Define the method +assembly+ for building a file with the C# compiler?
Done.

== Predefined tasks

Add a 'distclean' task that removes all files and directories
generatet by any file task.
Done (AutoClean generator).

== Java plugin

At least for the 1.0.0 release.
